This project constructs a cellular automaton based on data the user enters.
The program can be given a binary or decimal value as a seed which is used to build a cellular automaton, with an initial true value being placed somewhere in the first row.
All following rows are based on the row before them. 
The purpose of this project is to observe interesting patterns that occur in the generated automaton based on specific seeds.
